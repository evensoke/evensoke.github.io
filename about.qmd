This personal website is used to host my portfolio of past geospatial projects through classwork and jobs. Through my experience, I have learned to use R Studio and ArcGIS Pro in order to find, process, and synthesize geospatial data and databases. I have also had the ability to create my own geospatial database, hosted in excel, that was used to support National Park Service and Grad Student work.

The Portfolio tab of this website may take time to load since one of the datasets used was large and unwieldy. More information on how I solved this issue can be found in the "Data wrangling to create a personalized map" project description.
